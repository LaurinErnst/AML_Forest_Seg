\textbf{\color{red} Erster Satz}

Satellite imagery has been around for a long time now and with a rising number of satellites and increasing access to their data, the need for automated analysis has grown significantly over the past years. This analysis can be applied to a lot of areas, one of which is the estimation of forest area through satellites; it can be used by environmental departments to monitor growth of forests over a span of time or cartographers can utilise it to create a map with deatiled forest areas without having to go over the images by hand.

Creating a tool to identify forest on a satellite image can be translated to a semantic segmentaion of said image. This raises some interesting questions about what we even want to define as a forest. How many trees does an area need to become a forest? Do we need to differentiate between coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests? Do we want to recognise forests in all seasons, even though they look very different in summer, fall and winter for example? How large does a clearing have to be to be counted as not forest?
